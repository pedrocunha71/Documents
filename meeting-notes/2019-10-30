# I3S meeting notes

## 28 November 2019: INE-Istat-Insee trilateral meeting


### Participants

INE: Sónia & Pedro
Istat: Mauro  & Pina
Insee: Benoît


### Subjects discussed

Survey draft for Deliverable 1: The two changes proposed by Benoit were accepted. France and Portugal considered that the Survey is ready to be disseminated. However Mauro will read the draft and make suggestions soon. If we have the final version before the programmed date, it was agreed that the dissemination could happen sooner.
Portugal will prepare a draft of the mail announcing the survey. After revision of the text, and existing contact list it will be emailed  to Pierre Peyronnel  the announcement of the Web Survey.  Sonia knows Pierre from other projects and can introduce Pedro to him beforehand.
Communication Kit for Deliverable 4: The flier presented by France about JDemetra+ was very well received by all members and it was emphasized that it’s in line with the guidelines we already suggested in the mail sent in 11 October, although the flier was made before that.
Portugal suggested that some guidelines should be made and delivered to all members states that want to promote the services they share with the ESS. Those guidelines should be different depending on the receiver: Manager, IT, Subject Matter Specialist or Methodologist.
France will make a video with the experience on JDemetra+ with one member of the team responsible for the project. The flier and the video could be presented in the Toulouse hackathon.
The other services that were proposed to be described as a success story are:
•	ARC – That France will be implementing soon and can prepare another flier;
•	RELAIS (Record linkage at Istat) – That was developed by Italy.  Mauro and Giuseppina will produce the flier so that a draft can be presented in Toulouse.
•	PxWeb – Since Portugal will not be using this service, we can only assist with our evaluation but we are not the appropriate partner for the flier since it was not a success story. So, it was suggested to contact Jakob Engdahl with our input and check if the Swedish colleagues are able to put it together. Sonia knows Jakob from other projects and can introduce Pedro to him beforehand.
